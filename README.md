M5_abundance_ranked_filtered.tsv ==> Phylogeny and abundance data from both sets of M5 MAGs

combined_M1_w_abundance.tsv ==> Phylogeny and abundance data from both sets of M1 MAGs

filtered_combined_tree_colored_abundance_lines.png ==> Tree with both sets of MAGs from M5 together and a self normalized relative abundance heatmap to highlight changes in abundance

combined_tree_colored_abundances_named_nolines.png ==> Tree with both sets of MAGs from M5 together with an absolute heatmap of relative abundance 

m5_25_tree... ==> what it says on the tin, self normalized heatmap

m5_3_tree... ==> again, what it says on the label, self normalized heatmap
